# Introduction

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.
It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.


## System requirements

Poetry requires Python 3.6+. It is multi-platform and the goal is to make it work equally well
on Windows, Linux and OSX.


## Installation

Installing Poetry is as simple as:

```bash
pip install --user poetry
```

!!!note

    In the future, Poetry will come with its standalone installer.
